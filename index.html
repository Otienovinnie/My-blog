        <h1>How I Started Coding</h1>
        <p>My journey into the world of coding began at a young age. I was always fascinated by computers and how they
            worked. I started by tinkering with basic HTML and CSS, creating simple web pages for fun.</p>
        <p>As I grew older, I realized that coding was not just a hobby, but a valuable skill that could open up many
            opportunities. I decided to take it more seriously and enrolled in online courses to learn programming
            languages like Python and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Through dedication and practice, I gradually improved my skills and started working on real projects. I found
            joy in solving problems and building applications that could make a difference.</p>
        <p>Today, I am proud to say that I am a confident coder, and I continue to learn and grow every day. Coding has
            not only become a career for me but also a passion that I cherish.</p>
   <h1>Understanding <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr></h1>
        <h2>From Curiosity to Code: My Journey Into HTML</h2>
        <p>If you told me a year ago that I’d be writing code, I probably would’ve laughed. I wasn’t the “techie” type, and I didn’t even know what HTML stood for. But one day, something clicked — and that click came from curiosity.</p>
<h2>It All Started With a Simple Question</h2>
<p>I remember browsing a website and wondering: <i>How does this even work?</i> Everything looked clean — images, text, buttons — but I had no idea how it all came together behind the scenes.

That innocent question became a rabbit hole. I Googled <b>how websites are built</b>, and the first thing I kept seeing was something called <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>,” they said — the skeleton of every webpage.</p>
<h2>Learning the Basics</h2>
<p>I opened up freeCodeCamp and started the HTML module. At first, it was strange: tags like <!--add heading tag,p tag and the rest--> felt like learning a new language.
</p>
<p>But as I practiced, things started to make sense.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><!--add tag header tag--> That's a heading.</li>
        <li><!--add p tag--> A paragraph.</li>
        <li> <!--add img tag-->Image tag.</li>
        <li><!--add a link tag--> A link.</li>
        </ul> 
<P>I realized HTML isn’t hard — it’s actually <b>like telling the browser what each part of your content is</b>. And once you <q>get</q> that, a whole new world opens up.</P>
<h2>My First “Aha!” Moment</h2>
<p>The first time I wrote this:</p>
<!--add html code hello world-->
<p>...and saw it appear in the browser, I was hooked. It felt like I had just created something from scratch. Something mine.

That moment gave me the confidence to keep learning. I started building small pages — a personal bio, a list of my favorite songs, even a fake product landing page.</p>

<h2>What i know  now</h2>
<p>Today i can,</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Structure entire pages with semantic HTML</li>
        <li>Use forms, lists, tables, and multimedia tags</li>
        <li>Keep my HTML clean and accessible</li>
        </ul>
<p>More importantly, I understand that <b>HTML isn’t just code — it’s communication.</b> It tells the browser what your content is, and tells assistive tech (like screen readers) how to present it to others.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>After HTML came CSS, then JavaScript. But I’ll always remember that first spark — learning how to write a simple line of code that changed the way I see the web.<br>So if you’re just starting out and feel overwhelmed: don’t. Open your code editor. Type a line. Save the file. Open it in a browser.<br>
That’s how it starts.</p>
<p><b>Thanks for reading and happy coding</b></p>
