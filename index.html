<h1>How I Started Coding</h1>
<p>My journey into the world of coding began at a young age. I was always fascinated by computers and how they worked. I started by tinkering with basic HTML and CSS, creating simple web pages for fun.</p>
<p>As I grew older, I realized that coding was not just a hobby, but a valuable skill that could open up many opportunities. I decided to take it more seriously and enrolled in online courses to learn programming languages like Python and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Through dedication and practice, I gradually improved my skills and started working on real projects. I found joy in solving problems and building applications that could make a difference.</p>
<p>Today, I am proud to say that I am a confident coder, and I continue to learn and grow every day. Coding has not only become a career for me but also a passion that I cherish.</p>
