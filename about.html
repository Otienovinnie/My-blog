<p>Hi there! <br>
I'm currently learning web development and exploring the exciting world of building websites. I'm still a beginner, focusing on the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Every day brings something new to learn, and I'm enjoying the journey—even when it gets a little challenging!

This blog is where I document what I’m learning, share small projects, and reflect on my progress. If you're also learning or just curious, feel free to follow along!</p>
